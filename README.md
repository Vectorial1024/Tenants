# Description

This mod was inspired by https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753498552]Orion's Hospitality and my desire to have longer-term interations with NPC colonists. This is not intended as a replacement for Hospitality; Hospitality enhances the visitor system in Rimworld while Tenants are more like regular colonists that simply have restrictions on what they do. Both mods work together just fine!
 
Tenants are colonists that you cannot directly control or assign to tasks. So long as you have a regular colonists present, they can randomly offer to make a contract to stay at your colony. If you prove to be a good host, they may ask to stay longer. If you mistreat them, they might leave or worse!
Couriers are responsible for delivering silver and they spawn randomly. However, they can be called for through the comms console for a small fee.
 
# Features



- Non-controllable tenant colonists that pay you for being able to live in your colony.
- Invite tenants to stay at your colony via the Comms Console.
- Tenants may ask to extend their contract.
- Happy tenants may ask to join your colony.
- Couriers to deliver money. This feature will be further enhanced.
- A mailbox(misc) building requirement to have the events spawning.
- Evicting a tenant will receive in no money paid.
- Mistreating tenants may result in future consequences.
- Tenant that don't have the colony's best interest in mind.
- New Tenant tab to manage your tenants!
- Customizable mod settings!
